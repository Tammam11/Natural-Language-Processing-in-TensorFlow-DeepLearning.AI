# Natural Language Processing with TensorFlow

This repository contains code and resources from the **Natural Language Processing with TensorFlow** course by DeepLearning.AI. It focuses on building natural language processing (NLP) systems using TensorFlow, applying various deep learning techniques, and working with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs).

## What You Will Learn

- **Text Processing**: Learn how to preprocess text data, including tokenization and representing sentences as vectors.
- **Deep Learning for NLP**: Implement RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs in TensorFlow to handle natural language data.
- **Generating Text**: Train LSTM models on existing text data to generate original content, including poetry.
- **TensorFlow Techniques**: Use TensorFlow to process and model text data effectively.

## Skills Gained

- **Data Processing**: Handling and cleaning text data for machine learning models.
- **Deep Learning**: Building neural networks, including RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs, for NLP tasks.
- **Machine Learning**: Applying machine learning techniques in the context of NLP.
- **Text Mining**: Extracting useful insights and patterns from textual data.
- **Applied Machine Learning**: Implementing models in real-world applications.
- **TensorFlow**: Using TensorFlow for building deep learning models.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Handling and processing natural language data with advanced techniques.
- **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML)**: Developing AI models that can generate and interpret human language.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of deep learning techniques, specifically LSTMs, in the domain of natural language processing. The project uses TensorFlow to build and train models that can generate text based on the input data, including poetry generation.
